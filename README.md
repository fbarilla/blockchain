# Confidential Assets Demo

## Introduction

The Confidential Assets feature of Elements blockchain platform allows competing parties to interact
within the same blockchain without revealing crucial information to each other, such as the asset 
identities and quantities transferred in a given period.

This is a simple demonstration showing a scenario where a coffee shop (Dave the merchant) charges
a customer (Alice) for coffee using a given type of asset, which the customer does not presently hold.
To facilitate the purchase, the customer makes use of a point exchange system (Charlie) to convert one
of their other assets into the one Dave accepts.

Bob is a competitor trying to gather info about Dave's sales. Due to the CT/CA feature of Elements,
the idea is that he will not see anything useful at all by processing transactions on the blockchain.

Fred is completely uninteresting but necessary as he makes blocks on the blockchain when transactions
enter his mempool.

## Prerequisites

The demo uses the following libraries/tools:

* [Elements blockchain platform](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

Installation (Go and jq):
* (linux) using apt as `golang-1.7` and `jq`
* (macOS) using brew as `golang` and `jq`

## Installation and set up

The demo is written in Go with some HTML/JS components for UI related stuff.

The demo must be built. This can be done using the `build.sh` script.

There are five nodes, one for each party mentioned above, as well as several assets that must be
generated and given to the appropriate party before the demo will function. This can be automated using
the `start_demo.sh` script. For this to work, you must have `elementsd`, `elements-tx`, and `elements-cli`
in the path. E.g. by doing `export PATH=$PATH:/home/me/workspace/elements/src` or alternatively by doing
`make install` from `elements/src` beforehand.

`start_demo.sh` essentially does the following:

1. Sets up 5 Elements blockchain platform nodes and connects them to each other.
2. Generates the appropriate assets.
3. Sends assets to the appropriate parties.
4. Starts up the appropriate demo-specific daemons.

After this, open two pages in a web browser:
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (the customer Alice's UI)
- http://127.0.0.1:8030/order.html (the merchant Dave's order page)
- http://127.0.0.1:8030/list.html (the merchant Dave's admin page)

The idea is that Dave presents Alice with his UI, and Alice uses her UI (some app) to perform the
exchange.
